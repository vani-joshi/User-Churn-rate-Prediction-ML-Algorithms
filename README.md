# Predicting User Churn rate using Machine Learning Algorithms.

Problem Statement : This notebook contains the different Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the user churn rate (also known as user retention rate), based on a number of factors (features). The dataset is from kaggle. The following 3 Algorithsm have been developed in order to solve this problem :
1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. XGboost Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier

Also, the dataset is heavily imbalanced, therefore data balancing has been carried out (oversampling of minority class).
The notebook also contains EDA, correlation as well as Feature importance checks.
